    "In class, we explored the concept of eigendigits, which were a more information-rich basis for representing the handwritten digits of the MNIST dataset (see course lecture notes 12).  In fact, a similar procedure can be performed for any standardized images dataset.  In this problem, we will find so-called *eigenfaces*, which are pretty much as they sound: the principal components of a face dataset.  The faces that we will use can be found in the so-called 'labelled faces in the wild' data set.  This can be downloaded via the scikit-learn module as follows:"

    "By default, sklearn applies regularization to this problem, penalizing large parameter values.  You can control the degree of regularization by using the C=1e-4 keyword argument (or C=1e-6 or whatever).  However, it is not always clear what the best regularization should be.  To deal with this problem, sklearn offers the function LogisticRegressionCV, which automatically runs [k-fold cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)#k-fold_cross-validation) on a user-specified range of regularization parameters, and selects the one which minimizes the classification error.  Otherwise, it works just like LogisticRegression.  ***Use this function to determine the optimal value of the regularization parameter C, and report your classification accuracy with this new value.  Does regularization appreciably improve your classification accuracy? *** \n",
